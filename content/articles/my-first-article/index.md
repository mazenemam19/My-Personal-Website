## Why Your Portfolio Matters

Your portfolio is your digital handshake. It’s the first impression, the proof,
and the pitch—all in one. A great portfolio doesn’t just show what you’ve done;
it convinces people you’re the developer they need.

## What Makes a Portfolio Unforgettable?

- **Clarity:** Instantly communicates who you are and what you do.
- **Visual Impact:** Clean, modern, and memorable design.
- **Proof:** Real projects, real results, real testimonials.
- **Performance:** Fast, accessible, and works everywhere.

## Pro Tips for 2025

- Use bold, achievement-focused language.
- Add micro-interactions and subtle animations.
- Make your resume and contact info impossible to miss.
- Show off testimonials from real (or real-sounding) people.
- Lazy-load images for speed and performance.

## Example Code

```jsx
// Lazy-load an image in React
const Img = React.lazy(() => import('./MyImageComponent'));
```

## Final Thoughts

A great portfolio is your best investment. Make it count—and make them want to
hire you, no questions asked.
