I'm a Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience architecting and delivering high-performance web applications. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern frontend ecosystems with proven ability to lead development initiatives and optimize system performance.

I focus on building scalable solutions in SaaS and enterprise environments, with experience contributing to platforms serving manufacturing, analytics, and recruitment sectors across MENA and Europe.

My expertise includes leading technical migrations (recently reduced build times by 50% through Vite adoption), implementing real-time collaboration systems, and mentoring development teams to establish quality assurance processes.

Currently working as a Software Engineer at Siren Analytics, architecting enterprise-grade solutions for European clients while exploring advanced patterns in <ins>React Query</ins>, <ins>WebSocket infrastructure</ins>, and <ins>TypeScript optimization</ins>.
